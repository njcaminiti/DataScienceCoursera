Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.\nSmartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory\nDITEN - Universit? degli Studi di Genova.\nVia Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.\nactivityrecognition@smartlab.ws\nwww.smartlab.ws\n==================================================================\n\nThe experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. \n\nThe sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. \n\nFor each record it is provided:\n======================================\n\n- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.\n- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. \n- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. \n- Its activity label. \n- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.\n\nThe dataset includes the following files:\n=========================================\n\n- 'README.txt'\n\n- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.\n\n- 'features.txt': List of all features.\n\n- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.\n\n- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.\n\n- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.\n\n- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.\n\n- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.\n\nThe following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. \n\n- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. \n\n- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. \n\n- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. \n\n- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. \n\nNotes: \n======\n- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].\n- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.\n\nFor more information about this dataset contact: activityrecognition@smartlab.ws\n\nLicense:\n========\nUse of this dataset in publications must be acknowledged by referencing the following publication [1] \n\n[1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L.
